Today's Agenda:- 
----------------
1. Intro to Java
2. Tokens of Java
	Variables
	Constants
	Keywords
3. Data Types
4. Strcture of Java
5. First Program of Java
------------------------
What is a Java?
It is a Pure Object Oriented Progamming Language is used to develop different type of applications. 
		Desktop, Network, Web, Mobile, Device

Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS) is programming architecture which has set of concepts.

Based on OOPS there are different programming languages
		C++, C#.Net, VB.Net, JAva, Python, .....


The Lang's which follows 100% OOPS concept is called Pure OOPS. 

It has 3 Modules :- 
	J2SE :-  Java 2 Standard Edition  (Core Java)  :-  All the programming fundamentals.
	J2EE :-  Java 2 Enterprize Edition (Adv. Java) :-  Application Development will be done. 
	J2ME :-  Java 2 Micro Edition	:-  It is meant for developing Mobile Apps. 

All java applications are platform independent applications. 
--------
Program :-  Collection of / set of instruction should be given to the computer for a specific task.
			or
		Solution for a problem statement. 

There are some elements needed to write a program, those elements called as tokens. 
			Variables, Constants, Keywords, .....


Variable:- It is a named memory location to store values temporarly. 
				(or)
		It is an identifier where the values can change whenever we need it. 

		Rules :-  
			1. Variable Name must be one word.
			2. Variable name must start with either an alphabet / a symbol (_).
			3. Keywords should not be as variable name.

		Syntax:-
			<data type>  <variablename> [= <value>]

Constant :-  It is also kind of variable but it will not allow to modify value once it is assigned 		during the program execution.

Keyword :-  
    These are special words of the programming lang, which has specific action within the language.
		there are so many keywords are exist
				byte, char, int, long, double, float, private, public, protected,
				void, if, else, for, switch, case, break, boolean, class, enum, 
				extends, implements, interface, static, do, while, continue,....

Data Type:- Classification of the data. 

In General Data is classified into two types
		1.  Textual Data :-  
				Character  :-  It is an alphabet/a digit/a symbol
				String :-     Collection of characters
		2.  Numeric Data
				Integers  :-  All whole numbers
				Decimals  :-  All real numbers
As per the programming there are two types of data types
		1.  Value Type Data Types
			These are allows to store values directly in variable. (or)
			here all primitive data types(data types providing by lang).
				Keywords :-  byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean 
		2.  Reference Type Data Types
			These are allows to store values in the form of objects. (or)
			here user defined data types also called reference type.
				Keywords :-  enum, class


Integer Data Type Keywords :-   byte, short, int, long
Decimal Data Type Keywords :-   float, double
Character Data Type Keywords :-  char
Boolean Type Keyword :-  boolean

For Every variable, there is a name, value and it's capacity exist.
 
int x = 100;
float y = 12.34;
char ch = 'A';   // every character value should enclose within the single quotes('  '). 
boolean b = true;
---------------------------------
Structure of Java:- 

importing packages 
class <classname>
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		body of the program
	}
	.....
}

1. Package:- As per java packages are library files of the java progrmming lang.
		A package consist of "Collection of classes, interface, and inner classes, ....". 
		Every class consist collection of methods/funtions.
			java.util, java.lang, java.io, java.sql, .....
		there is a keyword called as "import" to get a package into program. 
				import java.util.*;	// * represents all the classes
				import java.util.Scanner; // Scanner is only one class

2.  Every java program starts with "class"  and identified with "classname". 
3.  Every class contains collection of user defined methods along with main() method. 
4.  Program execution starts wtih main() method, and it will not return any value(void).
5.  Every java program having an extension .java and classname will be the filename. 
-------------------
Output Statement :-   This statment prints output on Moniter. 

System.out.println("stmt"/variable) :-  it prints line by line.
System.out.print("stmt"/variable) :-  it prints side by side.
----------------------------

class DemoClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Welcome to Java Learners");
	}
}

Software Requirements :- 
-----------------------
For Java,  we need to download JDK with specific version. 
JDK :-  Java Development Kit

jdk 8.0 and above version. 
One IDE :- Eclipse 
-----------------------
Once JDK is installed, it will install two softwares, 
	JVM :-  Java Virtual Machine
			It will take entire program execution process. 
			It consist of different OS enviornments. 

	JRE :-  Java Runtime Enviornment
		It will provide enviornment for java application along with it's suiable library.
------------------------
Operators :- It is a symbol which has specific action b/w operands. 

Arithematic :-  +, -, *, /, %
Relational :-  >, <, >=, <=, !=(not equals), ==(equals)
Logical :-  &&(AND), ||(OR), !(Not)
Unary :-  ++ (increment  by 1)
	   -- (decrement by 1)
Assignment :-   =, +=, -=, /=, *=, %=
conditional :-   ? : (<condition> ? <true> : <false>)
bitwise :-   &, |, <<, >>
concatenation :- + ( it can used to concatenate two strings / string with any other type value)
-----------------------
Scanner Class :- 
this class is used to read values into variable at the time of program execution. 

Steps :- 
	1.  import Scanner class package
		import java.util.Scanner;
	
	2.  Create an object for Scanner class as follows
		Scanner <object> = new Scanner(System.in);
					System.in :- a specifies a device(keyboard).
	
	3. Use following methods
		int = nextInt()
		float = nextFloat()
		long = nextLong()
		double = nextDouble()
		String =  next(), nextLine()
		short  = nextShort()
		byte = nextByte()
		char  = nextCharacter()

	these methods has to used along Scanner Class Object.
		variable = scannerObj.methodname()
