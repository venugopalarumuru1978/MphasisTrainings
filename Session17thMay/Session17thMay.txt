	Queue
	LinkedList
		Single
		Doubly
		Circular
	Sorting Methods
	Searching Methods
------------------
Stack :- It is a linear data structure which follows a principle Last-In-First-Out.

Basic Operations :-

Push		:-  Adding elements
Pop		:-  Removing Elements
IsEmpty		:-  check if stack is empty
IsFull		:-  check if stack is full
Peek		:-  get top value from stack without removing
---------------------
Queue :-  It is also a linear data structure which follows a principle First-In-First-Out. 

Basic Operations :-

EnQueue		:-  Adding elements
DeQueue		:-  Removing Elements
IsEmpty		:-  check if stack is empty
IsFull		:-  check if stack is full
Peek		:-  get top value from stack without removing
----------------------------
LinkedList :- 

It is also one of the linear data structure which includes a series of connected nodes. 
Here Node is a combination of data and address of next node. 

These are classified into 3 types

1.  Single LinkedList
2.  Doubly LinkedList
3.  Circular LinkedList

Single LinkedList :- 
Doubly LinkedList :-
Circular LinkedList :- it is as same as SingleLinkedList but lastnode store first node address.

Sorting Methods :- 
------------------
1. Bubble Sorting
2. Insertion Sorting
3. Selection Sorting
4. Quick Sorting
5. Merge Sorting
