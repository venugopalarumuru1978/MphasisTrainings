Spring JDBC
Spring Web MVC
--------------
Spring JDBC:- 

JDBC:- 
	1.  Loading Drivers
	2.  Making Connection
	3.  Preparing and Executing SQL Queries
	4.  Exceptions has to be handled explicitly. 

In Normal JDBC, whenever we are executing an SQL Statement, everytime it will check loading drivers and checking db connection. 

Spring JDBC:- 
	1.  Loading Drivers and Making Connection will be done only once while loading an application.
	2.  Preparing and Executing SQL Queries won't check db connections a drivers everytime. 
	3.  No need maintains any exception handling explicitly. 


JdbcTemplate  :-  This class is used to execute sql queries.
			JdbcTemplate  <object> = new JdbcTemplate(dataSourceObj);

For DML queries(Insert/Update/Delete)
1. public int update(sql query string)
		jdbctemplateObj.update(sql query, [parameters]);
				here parameters always has to be taken in form of array of Object.
Insert into student values(?,?,?);

2. public List query(select stmt) = for multiple rows


Here "DataSource" class is used to making connection to database. Here as per Spring FW, db connection info has to be specified in config.xml file.

For Spring JDBC Application :-
------------------------------
1.  Create an Spring Application
2.  Add following dependencies
	spring-core
	spring-context
	spring-jdbc
	mysqlconnector

3.  Add xml configuration file, then add following code
======================================================================================================
Spring Web MVC :- 

It is one kind of architecture which allows to develop web applications by using Spring Framework. 

What is an MVC ? 

It is a Model View Controller, it is an architecture used to develop applications. It is mainly used to overcome the limitations of the traditional application development process. 

For Any Application Development, there are 3 layers

1.  Presentation Layer
			It is meant for UI(user interface). 
			If the app is web app:  HTML, CSS, JS, ...is used to create UI
2.  Business Layer
			It is meant for Developing Functionality of the application.
			here we required a programming language, JAVA/Spring FW	
3.  Data / Data Access Layer
			It is meant for Database
			MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / ....

here there are few limitations
	1.  At a time multiple people cannot work on multiple layers.
	2.  Development process will be slow

MVC will give solution for this limitations

MVC 

M - Model  => Data Access Layer
V - View   => Presentation Layer
C - Controller =>  Business Layer

Here mvc  will work all layer independently and finally all layers are integrated as an application.

For Any Web Page, there are 4 request methods are existed. 

GET  :-  to retrive somethign from server
POST :-  to send something to the server along with page. 
PUT
DELETE
