Servlets

What is a Web Server?

It is a software tool where it allows to send a request to the server and recieves response from the server based on request sent. 

Request :-  the information or url sending from client system to server system. 
Response :-  the information recieving from the server to client system. 

To work with server side programming,  there must be one web server software present in the system. 
there are different no of web server's are exist

1.  Apache Tomcat
2.  Web Logic
3.  Glass Fish

Now download and install Apache Tomcat.
Once tomcat server is configured in the system, there is a name of server and a port number exist. 

In Local System :-  server name is :  http://localhost
Default Port Number :- 8080 // if required, we can change it. 

so that total servername is :-  http://localhost:8080/

it has an ip address also:-  127.0.0.1  <==> http://127.0.0.1:8080/

localhost:8090/TestWebApp/first.html

What is a Servlet?

Servlet is a web technology which meant for creating server side web applications. 

Web Programming is classified into two types

1.  Client Side Programming (Static Pages)
	Here content of the web page will not be changed. It will be fixed content.
	Here pages are created with : HTML, CSS and JavaScript Only. 
2.  Server Side Programming (Dynamic Pages)
	Here content of the web page will be changes according to the situations.
	Here pages are created wtih : HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Server Side Technologies like 		Servlets, JSP, ....

Servlets is one of the web tech where it allows to write server side coding using java. 

Servlets  are having WEB API's which means there is collection of interfaces and classes where are web related. 

What is a Servlet?  

As per the code, It is a class where it consist collection of methods where it is having some part of coding. 

To work with servlets use follwoing two packages

javax.servlet
package contains many interfaces and classes that are used by the servlet or web container. These are not specific to any protocol.

javax.servlet.http 
package contains interfaces and classes that are responsible for http requests only.

http :-  hyper text transfer protocal  :- to view web page
https :-  s- secure  :- to view web page with security  

Servlet interface provides commonbehaviorto all the servlets

Steps to create a servlet:- 

1.  Create a Dynamic Web Project
2.  Create a servlet with following steps
	Right Click on src/main/java => New => Servlet =>  Provide servlet classname => next=> next=>
	Select following checkboxes(init, destroy, service) => Finish
3.  Add servlet-api.jar file to the application from tomcat(lib folder) server	
4.  Now code the methods of servlet class as per the requirement.
-----------------------
How to execute servlet with the html page:-

a.  Create a html page then include "submit" button along with <form> tag as follows
<form  name="name of form"   method="POST/GET"  action="servletname">
	<input type="submit"  value="button name"  ... />
</form>

Method specifies that how the web page is communicating with server

POST :-  page is submitting to the server. i.e. send page to the server along with data. 
		here "submit" button will submit the page to the server along with data.
GET :-  page is getting info from the server. 
------------------------------
How to send data from html page to servlet page:

a.  Create a html page with required fields designing.(Ex: login page, reg page)
b.  Include form tag , within that specify action="servlet name"
c.  Button Should be "submit" button. 
d.  Once data has been sent to the server, from server to get data into servlet, use following stmt
		Variable =  request.getParameter("toolname")

How to move from one page to another page using servlet
	response.sendRedirect("pagename");
