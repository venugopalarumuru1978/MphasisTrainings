What is a Testing?

Software testing a method to check weather the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that  software is bug free. 

Software Development Life Cycle, there are 3 stages

1.  Development
2.  Testing
3.  Deployment

Whenever an application comes for the testing, 
it need to be tested following things
	1.  Weather client requirements are matching or not.
	2.  Finding Bugs 
	3.  Performance of the application


To Test an application, there are two ways

1. Manual Testing
	In this type of testing, there some rules are exist, by following those rules the tester 
	has to test the application and prepares bug report in excel sheet if any  bugs finds, that 
	bug report will be sent development.
2. Automation
	In this type of testing, there are some tools are exist, by using those tools we automatize 	testing any application.
	
	QTP(Quick Test Process) :- it is used to test any type of application
			(Desktop GUI based application, Web Application)
	Selenium :-  It is meant for only testing web applications. 
----------------------------------
Different Types of testings 

1.  Unit Testing
2.  Integration Testing
3.  Smoke Testing
4.  White Box Testing
5.  Black Box Testing
-----------------------------------
What is an Selenium?
It is free(open source) automated testing framework used to validate webapplication across different browsers and platforms. We can use this framework on multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python, etc for selenium scripts. 

Software Requirements to work with Selenium:-

1.  Java
2.  Any IDE(Eclipse)
3.  Browser
4.  Selenium Software

Selenium Tool Suite

1.  Selenium  IDE	:-  
		Purpose of the IDE is to record selenium script and can play whenever is needed.
2.  Selenium  RC(Remote Control):-
		Testing process will be done with the help of Client Server Enviornment, Now a days it 		is out-dated.
3.  Selenium Web Driver	:- 
		It is the actual software to write selenium coding.
4.  Selenium Grid :-  
		With the help of Grid, we can test multiple applications at a time. 
--------------------

To Write Selenium Program, First we need to identify first web elements in following ways
ID		:-  It allows to identify, an html element with ID Prop.
Name		:-  It allows to identify, an html element with Name Prop.
ClassName
LinkText
PartialLinkText
TagName
CSSSelector
XPath
