Steps :- 
1.  Configure json server with specific table and start that server. Keep that json file into application  folder.
2. Open Angular application, then add the components which are requiered. 
3. Design the component as per the required. 
4. Create a service in angular app, then define all the api calls in that service
5. Add "HttpClientModule" package in app.module.ts file.
6. Call that service methods whereever it is needed. 
------------
1. Searching, Sorting and Pagination
---------------------------------
1.  Create an application where it show all the employee information using json-server.
2.  install following modules
		npm install ng2-search-filter  = searching 
		npm install ng2-order-pipe     = sorting
		npm install ngx-pagination@5.0 = pagination

3.  Add following modules in app.module.ts file. 
import { Ng2OrderModule } from 'ng2-order-pipe';
import { Ng2SearchPipeModule } from 'ng2-search-filter';
import { NgxPaginationModule } from 'ngx-pagination';
4.  Now implement searching process
	a. add a textbox in html page.
	b. create a method where filter functionality then add that function to the textbox 
			(ngModelChange)="funname()"
5. Sorting purpose :-
	a. create a function  by name "Sort(colname)"  then add the functionality
	b. Implement that function in colmn headings of the table 
		<th  (click)="sort('colname')">Heading</th>
	c. While presenting data, use "orderBy" as follows
			<tr  *ngFor="let e of empinfo | orderBy:key:reverse>
6. Pagination Purpose :
	a. Add the following tag in table tag
		<pagination-controls (pageChange)="p = $event"></pagination-controls>
			here p is a numeric variable
	b. Now add following pipe in data presentation
	<tr *ngFor="let e of empinfo |  paginate:{itemsPerPage:3,currentPage:p}">

Json  Server

db.json file

{
"tablename" : [
	{
		"id":value,
		"colname":value, 
		.......
	},
	{
		"id":value,
		"colname":value, 
		.......
	}
	............
],
"tablename": [
	{
		"id":value,
		"colname":value, 
		.......
	},
	{
		"id":value,
		"colname":value, 
		.......

	............
],
......
}

What is meant by a Guard?
The Guard is a service that executes at the specified situation while angular application is navigating b/w one route to another route. 

there mainly two types of Guards are exist
	1. CanActivate    :- Executes before entering into a route
	2. CanDeactivate  :- Execute before leaving a route

How to create a guard
		ng g guard  <guardname>

Once guard is created and coded, that has to be implemented while defining routes in app-routing.modules.ts

{path:"routename", component:componentname, CanActivate:[guardname]}
