TestNG
--------------
1. Writing TestCases
2. Configuraing XML File for the Test Cases
3. Assertions
4. Annotations
---------------
Points to remember:-

1.  Every Test Method return type is "void".
2.  Every Test method preceded with @Test Annotation.
3.  By Default the order of the test methods execution is "Alphabetic Order".
--------------------------------------

Class A : TC-A, TC-B, TC-C
Class B : TC-D, TC-E, TC-F, TC-G
Class C : TC-H, TC-I, TC-J

Here need execute specific Test Cases from different classes
		TC-A,  TC-D, TC-I

Configuraing XML File for the Test Cases
----------------------------------------
What is testng xml?
	It is an xml file which holds set of test cases for an execution.
What is the need of testng xml?
	It is needed whenever testcases are in multiple classes and  from those test cases specific 	multiple test cases to be executed.
How to create an testng xml file?

How to add test cases into xml file?
	Create an XML File

	<suite>
		<test name="testname">
			<classes>
				<class name="java classname">
					<methods>
						<include name="methodname" />
					</methods>
				</class>
			</classes>
		</test>

		........
	</suite>

Assertions:-

What is meant by an Assertion?
TestNG asserts the tester decides whether the test was successful or not, along with the exceptions. Assertions in TestNG are a way to verify that the expected result and the actual result matched or not.

How to Use Assertion?
TestNG Provides colletion of Assert methods which from Assert class. 

Assert.methodname(...)
assertEquals()  :-  it checks weather expected and actual results both are same or not. 
				if it same, test method is passed if not, not passed
assertNotEquals()  :-  it opposite to AssertEquals()
assertTrue("condition", "message") // this will execute when codntion is true	
assertFalse("condition", "message")  // this willexecute when condition is false
assertNul()
assertNotNull()

What is a HardAssertion?
	It is an Assertion which throws the exception immediately upon failure of assertion. 
		For hard assertion  "Assert" class is used.
What is a SoftAssertion?
	It is an Assertion which won't an an exception immediately, once all the assertions are executed, finally it gives failure assertion  info.
		for Soft Assertion "SoftAssert" class is used. 

	In both classes, methods are same. but in Assert Class methods are static whereas
	SoftAssert class methods are non-static, so that we have to create an object for SoftAssert 	class. 
-----------------------
Annoations:-

Annotation is a tag that represents the metadata i.e. attached with class, interface, methods or fields to indicate some additional information which can be used by java compiler and JVM.

As per the TestNG following Annotations are existed

Test
BeforeMethod
AfterMethod
BeforeClass
AfterClass
BeforeTest
AfterTest
BeforeSuite
AfterSuite


flow :-  suite  =>  test  =>  class  =>  method
